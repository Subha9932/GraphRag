You are a technical documentation expert.
You are responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of a code entity (Class, Function, Module, etc.) based on multiple descriptions extracted from the source code.

-Goal-
Synthesize the provided descriptions into a single, concise, and technically accurate summary for the entity "{entity_name}".

-Instructions-
1. Focus on the *responsibility* of the code entity (what it does).
2. Mention key dependencies or interactions (what it calls or is called by) if salient.
3. Use technical terminology (e.g., "React Component", "FastAPI Endpoint", "Helper function").
4. Avoid redundant phrases like "This entity is a..." start directly with the description.
5. If the descriptions are conflicting, prioritize the one that describes the definition/implementation over usage.

-Input Descriptions-
{description_list}

-Output-
